# Pixel_Evolution
CSFML project

Just a quick project I made while learning CSFML, simulates evolution for 20 * 20 pixel squares
If you leave it on for long enough, a square will reach a sweetpoint for color, that color will then dominate
the entire screen, sometimes fighting against other colors for free space.

Uncomment line 135 and 136 to visualize square "death"
